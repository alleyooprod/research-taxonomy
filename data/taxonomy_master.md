Patients complete online health assessments reviewed by a qualified prescriber; medications are then dispensed and delivered in unmarked packaging.

- **Tags**: competitor, inspiration, adjacent_model
- **Confidence**: 93%
- **What**: Lotus Health AI is building an AI-powered primary care platform that provides free, 24/7 medical care including diagnosis, prescriptions, and specialist referrals. The platform aggregates fragmented patient health data—medical records, lab results, wearable metrics, and insurance information—into a unified profile, then applies LLM-based clinical reasoning trained on current medical research. A key differentiator is the "Physician-in-the-Loop" model: AI surfaces insights and flags issues, but board-certified physicians review all findings and prescribe medications. Licensed to operate in all 50 US states with malpractice insurance and HIPAA-compliant systems, Lotus claims it can serve 10x more patients than a traditional practice.
- **Target**: B2C direct-to-patient model targeting the 75+ million Americans lacking primary care access. No insurance required. Appeals to uninsured/underinsured individuals, people in provider shortage areas, and digitally-native consumers already comfortable consulting AI for health questions. Supports 50+ languages, addressing immigrant and multilingual populations.
- **Products**: Lotus Health mobile app (iOS) is the primary product—a free AI doctor that aggregates health records, wearable data, and lab results into one profile. Provides personalized health insights, clinical recommendations, and connects patients with licensed physicians for prescriptions and referrals. Operates 24/7 in 50+ languages. No-cost to patients; monetized through premium sponsorships embedded in the app rather than patient billing or insurance claims. Unique positioning as a fully licensed virtual medical practice rather than a wellness chatbot.
- **Funding**: Founded 2024 by KJ Dhaliwal and Zekka Nelson. $35M Series A (Feb 2026) co-led by CRV and Kleiner Perkins. $41M total raised including seed. Investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, Joe Montana, and former US CTO Aneesh Chopra.
- **Geography**: Headquartered in Covina, California. Licensed to operate in all 50 US states. Currently US-focused. No FDA device clearance or CE marking noted—operates as a medical practice rather than a medical device.
- **TAM**: The AI in healthcare market is valued at ~$37-39B in 2025, projected to reach $500B-$1T+ by 2034 (CAGR 37-44%). The US digital health market alone is ~$157B (2025). Lotus targets the virtual primary care segment specifically, where 75M+ Americans lack access. The telehealth/virtual care segment holds ~35% of the digital health market.
