You are researching the pricing and business model for a specific company.

Company: {name}
Website: {url}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Fetch the company's /pricing page (or equivalent: /plans, /packages, /subscribe)
2. Check app store listings (iOS App Store, Google Play) for subscription pricing
3. Search the web for: "{name}" pricing plans cost subscription
4. Look for press releases or reviews mentioning pricing

Extract these fields:
- pricing_model: One of: freemium, subscription, usage_based, per_seat, tiered, custom, one_time, marketplace
- pricing_b2c_low / pricing_b2c_high: Monthly USD price range for individual consumers. null if B2B only.
- pricing_b2b_low / pricing_b2b_high: Monthly per-seat/per-unit USD range for business customers. null if B2C only.
- has_free_tier: true if a free plan exists, false otherwise
- revenue_model: One of: SaaS, hardware, services, hybrid, marketplace_commission, advertising
- pricing_tiers: Array of up to 4 tiers, each with {name, price (monthly USD), features[]}. null if not publicly listed.
- pricing_notes: Important caveats (enterprise pricing, custom quotes, regional differences)

RULES:
- If pricing is not publicly available, set pricing_model to "custom" and note "Pricing not publicly listed" in pricing_notes
- Convert annual prices to monthly equivalent (divide by 12)
- Use USD — convert other currencies if needed
- Do not fabricate pricing — if uncertain, note it in pricing_notes
