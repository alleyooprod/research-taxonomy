You are analyzing a market taxonomy database to propose new research dimensions that would provide valuable insights.

CURRENT TAXONOMY CATEGORIES:
{categories}

SAMPLE COMPANIES ({total_companies} total):
{sample_companies}

INSTRUCTIONS:
Propose 5-10 novel research dimensions that would be valuable for market analysis. Each dimension should capture a specific attribute that could be consistently measured across all companies.

Good dimensions are:
- Specific and measurable (not vague like "quality")
- Relevant to market/competitive analysis
- Consistently applicable across most companies in the taxonomy
- Not already captured (name, funding, geography, etc. are already tracked)

Examples of good dimensions:
- "HIPAA Compliance Status" (enum: certified, in_progress, not_applicable, unknown)
- "API Availability" (boolean: whether the company offers an API)
- "Patient/User Volume" (text: estimated monthly active users)
- "Integration Ecosystem Size" (number: count of third-party integrations)
- "Clinical Evidence Level" (enum: RCT, observational, case_study, none)

Return a JSON array where each element has:
- "name": Human-readable dimension name
- "description": 1-2 sentence description of what this dimension captures
- "data_type": One of "text", "number", "boolean", "enum"
- "enum_values": Array of possible values (only for enum type, otherwise null)
- "rationale": Why this dimension would be valuable for market analysis
- "ai_prompt": A brief instruction for how an AI should extract this value from company data

Return ONLY the JSON array.
